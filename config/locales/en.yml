# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    about_app_title: 'The App'
    about_app_text_p1: '<b>Falaê</b> is an Android application developed by HP volunteers from Brazil R&D in partnership with the NGO Educandário – Centro de Reabilitação São João Batista. It is an Alternative Communication app, that allows people with speech and mobility impairments to communicate by using pictograms (images or symbols) that represent words (verbs, nouns, adjectives etc).'
    about_app_text_p2: 'The main goal of this project is to make the app completely free and unlimited. Up to now, all of the Alternative Communication apps known by the NGO are paid and have limited functionalities. This is a barrier to low-income families. We wish to enable everyone, regardless of their income, to use this resource and overcome their difficulties.'
    about_app_text_p3: "<b>Falaê</b> consists of two parts: Android app and the web platform. The web page is used for user registering. Once registered, the user can customize their profile, as well as create and modify communication boards, pages and items. The Android app connects to the web platform in order to sincronize the user's data."
    about_app_text_p4: 'Another advantage of <b>Falaê</b> is its <a href="https://github.com/marcelorcorrea/falae">open source</a> nature. That is, anyone can freely download and/or modify the code to best fit their needs, as well as contribute to the open source community.'
    about_app_text_p5: 'The pictographic symbols used are property of CATEDU (<a href="http://catedu.es/arasaac/">http://catedu.es/arasaac/</a>) under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/es/">Creative Commons</a> license and created by <a href="http://www.palao.es/">Sergio Palao</a>.'

    about_ngo_text_p1_quote: '“to promote the rehabilitation and social integration of children and teenagers with disabilities, providing them with adequate treatment and education, aiming a better quality of life and empowering them as citizens”.'
    about_ngo_text_p2: "It is an institution where children and teens have several specific classes and health treatments according to their needs entirely for free.
