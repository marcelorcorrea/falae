Once registered, the user can customize their profile, as well as create and modify communication boards, pages and items. The Android app connects to the web platform in order to synchronize user data. With the use of an Android device (tablet or smartphone), people with speech and mobility impairments can start a literacy and communication process away of any charges. To download and install the application, please access the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.falaeapp.falae">Google Play Store</a>.'
